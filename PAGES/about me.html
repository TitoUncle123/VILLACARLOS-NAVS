<h1>HELLO! :D </h1>
<h2>My name is Riggs L. Villacarlos of Grade 11-Lynx. This page is about me and my hobby, playing videogames. </h2>
<h2>Since childhood, I was able to play games at age of 3 playing family computer games like Contra, Super Mario, Castlevania, Battle City and more.</h2>
<h2>That time I discover videogames and I am completely fascinated by it. I know the moment I hold, it is my joy and entertainment.</h2>
<h2>Until now, I still play videogames because it is my favorite thing to do and not only relieve my stress but to enjoy myself without getting bored out of it.</h2>
<h2>I have so many games that I can't count how many of them within hundreds of games I play with my computer.When it comes to games, I am always update to the newest news and releases of games.</h2>
