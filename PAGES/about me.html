<h1>HELLO, NICE TO MEET YOU! :D </h1>
<h2>My name is Riggs L. Villacarlos of Grade 11-Lynx. This page is about me and my hobby, playing videogames. </h2>
<h2>Since childhood, I was able to play games at age of 3 playing family computer games like Contra, Super Mario, Castlevania, Battle City and more.</h2>
<h2>That time I discover videogames and I am completely fascinated by it. I know the moment I hold, it is my joy and entertainment.</h2>
<h2>Until now, I still play videogames because it is my favorite thing to do and not only relieve my stress but to enjoy myself without getting bored out of it.</h2>
<h2>I have vast of many games that I can't count how many of them within hundreds of games I play with my computer.When it comes to games, I am always update to the newest news and releases of games.</h2>
<h2>The genre of games I play are: RPG or JRPG, RTS, First-person Shooter, Survival Horror, Third-person Shooter, Fighting Game but my personal favorite is Hack & Slash </h2>
<h2>Not just games too but other things like watching anime, listening to music, hanging out with my friends but most of all, able to get along by playing games.</h2>
